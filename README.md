This python code is an advent calendar. It is german, so the text
is in german and it only has 24 "doors".
Each day, a new output image is generated, using different images
(one for each day) from the talented photographers at pixabay.com, which I download and
put in a file. Of course, you can use your own images, if you modify the code.

It also generates a message "Frohe Weihnachten" and displays how many nights are left till Christmas Eve.

This code uses the PIL library and datetime.

I hope you enjoy this digital and waste free advents calendar.
